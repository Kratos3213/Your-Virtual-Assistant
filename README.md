# Your Virtual Assistant
 Meet Pet, your intelligent, customizable virtual assistant built entirely with Python. Designed to streamline daily tasks and enhance productivity, PyAssist combines the flexibility of Python programming with cutting-edge AI tools to deliver a seamless, voice-activated experience.  Key Features: Voice Interaction:  Utilizes Python libraries like SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 for real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.  Responds to natural language commands (e.g., "What's the weather today?" or "Set a reminder for 5 PM").  Smart Task Management:  Schedule appointments, set reminders, and manage to-do lists with calendar integration.  Automate repetitive tasks using custom Python scripts.  Web & API Integration:  Fetch real-time data (weather, news, stock prices) using APIs like OpenWeatherMap or NewsAPI.  Control smart home devices via IoT integrations (e.g., Philips Hue, Alexa).  Browse the web, play YouTube videos, or search Wikipedia with voice commands.  AI-Powered Insights:  Leverages NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) to understand context and improve conversational accuracy.  Integrate ChatGPT for dynamic, human-like interactions and problem-solving.  Local & Offline Functionality:  Prioritizes privacy by processing sensitive tasks locally (no cloud dependency for basic commands).  Offline mode supports core features like reminders, calculations, and file management.  Customizable & Scalable:  Easily extend functionality with Python modulesâ€”add new commands, integrations, or workflows.  Modify wake words, voices, and responses to suit your preferences.  Cross-Platform Compatibility:  Runs smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.  Technical Highlights: Built with Python libraries like PyAudio, datetime, requests, and Tkinter (for GUI options).  Modular architecture allows developers to plug in new features or APIs effortlessly.  Lightweight and efficient, ideal for both beginners and advanced users to tweak or scale.  Security & Privacy: User data is stored locally by default, with optional encryption for sensitive information.  Open-source framework ensures transparency and community-driven improvements.
